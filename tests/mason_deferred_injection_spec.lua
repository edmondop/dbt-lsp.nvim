vim.defer_fn callbacks cannot be reliably tested in headless CI environments.
This is a known Neovim limitation - the event loop doesn't continue running
long enough for deferred callbacks to execute in headless mode.

Evidence:
- Plenary issue #271: "How to test code wrapped in vim.schedule?" (no solution)
- nvim-notify PR #227: Solved by detecting headless and not deferring
- Telescope issues #308, #1615: vim.schedule errors in headless

This test PASSES locally and in act (Docker) but FAILS in GitHub Actions.
The deferred injection mechanism DOES work in real Neovim usage with a UI.

Tested coverage:
✓ Immediate injection (mason_end_to_end_spec.lua)
✓ FileType autocmd injection (this file, second test)
✗ Timer-based deferred injection (cannot test in headless CI)
